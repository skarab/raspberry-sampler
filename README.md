# raspberry-sampler
Sampler for the Raspberry 2

Key concept is to have hardware knobs to live-edit a single sample,
envelop, start-end / looping points, filtering a bit...
Maybe a single pad to trigger the thing..

then it should allow to:
- easily attach a sample to a midi note (channel, note, maybe velocity)
- save presets (a map of midikey,sample, saved in xml file)

notes:
- midi input will be usb only.
- samples/presets will be on external usb key.
- there will be a simple 7-bars thing screen to show values.
- raspberry is running on gentoo, i'll provide the flash card image and schematics.
