# raspberry-sampler
Sampler for the Raspberry 2 & 3

Key concept is to have a box full of knobs to live-edit samples, linked to other instruments using midi.

Features:
- live edit the sample with knobs (start, end, envelop, pitch, loop points, filters...)
- easily attach/detach samples to midi instruments
- load/save banks to xml
