Key concept is to have hardware knobs to live-edit a single sample,
envelop, start-end / looping points, filtering a bit...

Features:
- store samples from network connection (shared samba folder)
- handle multiple banks (folders)
- usb midi input
- attach a sample to a midi note (channel, note, velocity)
- live edit the sample with knobs
- load/save bank parameters to xml
- 7-bars screen display edited values and infos (IP, state, ...)
- raspberry is running on gentoo, i'll provide the SD card image and schematics
