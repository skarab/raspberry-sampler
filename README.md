# raspberry-sampler
Sampler for the Raspberry 2 & 3

Key concept is to have a box full of knobs to live-edit samples, linked to other instruments using midi.

Features:
- live edit the sample with knobs (start, end, looping points, envelop, pitch, ...)
- import/edit banks of samples (folders) using LAN / shared samba folder
- load/save bank parameters to xml
- usb midi input, with multiple channels support
- easy attach a sample to a midi note, velocity may be defined in the xml to create instruments (piano, organ, ...)
- 7-bars screen displaying edited values and infos
- raspberry is running on gentoo, i'll provide the SD card image and schematics
