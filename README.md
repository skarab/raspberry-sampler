# raspberry-sampler
Sampler for the Raspberry 2 & 3

Key concept is to have a box full of knobs to live-edit samples, linked to other instruments using midi.
Unlike samplerbox, this is not about playing piano, but about toying samples like drums / special effects / noise ...

Features:
- live edit the sample with knobs (start, end, looping points, envelop, pitch, ...)
- import/edit banks of samples (folders) using LAN / shared samba folder
- load/save bank parameters to xml
- usb midi input, with multiple device/channels support
- easy attach a sample using midi
- 7-bars screen displaying edited values and infos
- raspberry is running on gentoo, i'll provide the SD card image and schematics
